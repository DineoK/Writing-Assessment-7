<h2> My routine and how I think I'll structure my days</h2>
<p>I work so much better when it's quiet and everyone is asleep. I find myself being a lot more productive at night than during the day. I am very flexible with my time so when my mind reminds me that I have work whether it's 2 in the morning ill get straight to it. Once I start, I can sit for about 3 hours then take a 30-minute break and get straight back to it, whether that includes my weekends too although what i will do is take the amount of cards in my backlog divided that with the number of days i have which will equal to how many i need to cover in a day to stay on track. I prefer to understand the work that I am doing so it takes me a bit longer, in comparison to quickly problem solving the problem or activity and getting it done with a lack of understanding.</p>
